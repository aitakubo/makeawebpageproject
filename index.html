    <h1>How to Grow Succulents</h1>
    <p>You may have once bought a succulent from Trader Joe's after hearing they're the easiest thing to take care of! Only for it to end up in a pile of mush by the end of the week.<p>
    <img src=images/common-signs-of-overwatered-succulents.jpeg alt="over-watered succulent" title="yuck!">
    <p>Succulents are not as easy as you might think, but fear not; with the right knowledge, they'll be thriving with minimal maintenance!</p>
    
    <h2>The 3 Big Rules:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lots of Sunlight</li>
        <li>Quick-Draining Soil</li>
        <li>Adequate Watering</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In general, these are the three main rules that will pertain to almost every succulent. The <strong>most</strong> important factor is the <strong>species of your plant</strong>. Care may differ from plant to plant, like growing seasons, watering needs, etc, so use google to your advantage! <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/succulents/" target=_blank>Reddit</a> is also a <em>great</em> source for identifying your plant. Try joining the succulents subreddit!</p>
