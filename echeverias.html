        <p>Echeverias are very popular for their flowery shape, but are actually one of the most difficult to take care of. </p>
        <p>They need <strong>lots</strong> of sunlight and very quick-draining soil. Echeverias can beccome etiolated (stretched) very easily without proper sunlight, ruining its pretty rosette shape. Given the right treatment, echeverias can be extremely prolific!</p>
