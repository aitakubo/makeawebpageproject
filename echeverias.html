        <p>Echeverias are very popular for their flowery shape, but are actually one of the most difficult to take care of. </p>
        <p>They need <strong>lots</strong> of sunlight and very quick-draining soil. Echeverias can become etiolated (stretched) very easily without proper sunlight, ruining its pretty rosette shape. Given the right treatment, echeverias can be extremely prolific!</p>
        <p>Some echeverias will produce <em>offshoots</em>, or mini rosettes that can be cut off to grow into their own plants. <em>Leaf propagation</em> and <em>beheading</em> are also options for propagation, but we'll go into depth about that later.</p>
        
        
        <p>Overall, compared to other succulents echeverias are particularly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sensitive to overwatering</li>
            <li>need extra sunlight (full sun)</li>
            <li>and easy to propagate.</li>
        </ul>
